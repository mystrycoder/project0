This project is about the birds around world.

I'm trying to make short desctiption about typs of birds around the world.

I've separated birds in three catagories following this adventure-journal.com: https://www.adventure-journal.com/2012/07/the-list-the-3-types-of-birds-in-the-world/

where all birds have been categorized following and I've created three different pages respectively the bird cateroies:
1. Tweety Birds
These are little birds that tweet. Examples include sparrows, finches, robins.

2. Ducky Birds
These are birds that float in water. Examples include ducks, swans, sea gulls, and albatrosses.

3. Hawk-like Birds
The birds of this category are, well, hawk-like in nature. Examples include eagles, vultures, and even chickens.
